      <description>Happy 2024! Hi, my name is Phil. Welcome!&#xA;I decided to start my side hustle as part of my 2024 New Year resolution. I hope to use this blog to motivate myself to continue working on my programming side projects. I will use it to hold myself accountable to work it throughout the year.&#xA;My English is horrible. I just used Grammarly to fix my errors.</description>
