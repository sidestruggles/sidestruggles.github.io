## Happy 2024!

Hi, my name is Phil. Welcome!

I decided to start my side hustle as part of my 2024 New Year resolution. I hope to use this blog to motivate myself to continue working on my programming side projects. I will use it to hold myself accountable to work it throughout the year.

My English is horrible. I just used [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to fix my errors.
